# SoLong

Welcome to SoLong, my first graphics project at 42 School! This project introduces basic graphics programming, where the task is to create a simple 2D game using a minimal graphical library. Working on SoLong helped me dive into rendering, handling user input, and basic game mechanics in C.

## Project Overview

SoLong is a 2D game where the player navigates through a maze to reach an exit. Along the way, the player collects items while avoiding obstacles. This project marks my first experience with graphical programming and real-time interactivity, so the code is a bit of an experiment in applying new concepts. The goal was to explore rendering techniques and learn to manage game states and inputs.

## Features

- **2D Graphics**: Renders a basic 2D map using a minimal graphics library.
- **Player Movement**: Supports movement within the maze, with collision detection for walls.
- **Collectibles and Exit**: Implements collectibles and an exit that completes the game upon reaching it.
- **User Input**: Handles keyboard input to control player movement.

## Usage

To play SoLong, clone the repository, compile the code, and launch the game. Make sure the graphics library is properly set up as required by the 42 School project specifications.

## Compilation

To compile the game, run:
```bash
make
```

This will create an executable to launch the game.

SoLong was a fun introduction to graphics programming and interactive applications. Feel free to explore the code and see where the journey into game development began!
